            <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>In the Unit 2 course of 10th grade SEP, I learned how to use the command-line-enabled git software to collaborate with other people on one repository on Github. I applied this knowledge to work with a partner on a project where the task was to create an interactive file path viewed on Github, of multiple files linked within other files starting from the readme.md on the homepage of the repository. Which ever file the user chooses determines the outcome of their adventure and the options they have after that choice, which are in the form of other text files linked within the file they chose.</p>
            
            <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>For this project, we had to include multiple files which are linked together within their text. Directories counted to show proper file structuring using the Integrated Development Environment. Two directories were created, one with all of the files which where in the part of the adventure I originally coded to Github, the first choice the user can make in which they enter the portal and all of the files linked within that file afterwards, and a second directory with all of the choices my partner coded. Everything I did is in the red outline in the diagram, and my partner's part of the adventure is outlined in blue.</p>
            
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            
                <h4>Challenges</h4>
            I struggled with setting up the file path as I didn't undertstand that the file structure of the which the user clicks through to reveal the outcome and next coresponding linked files they can choose does not have anything to do with how they can be linked. 
            
            I didn't understand why files, except for empty files, were needed as the only way to link a path from the directories page on the homepage of the repository is to make all of the options the user can click on empty directories (having to be typed out with no spaces and also) with the other options being directories within that folder, each folder having to be created with empty files so that it could be committed to Github. 
            
            I had to go back to the example on the original CYOA assignment to see the demo in which the files are simply linked in text starting from the README.md file. This made it clear that no directories or actual file structure is needed for the in-text linked files, and directories where only required to show proper use of the Integrated Development Environment to make directories and structure files, such as all of the ones I linked together on Github, and all of the files my partner created and linked.
