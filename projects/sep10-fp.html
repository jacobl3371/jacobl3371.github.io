            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>The Freedom Project is a course long project wherein students combine all of the knowledge they learned throughout the course, in the case of SEP 10, this entails using the knowledge of HTML and CSS (basic web design) and Bootstrap (advanced web design) as well as a software tool of my choosing to create a website which addresses the currently existing and future technologies in an industry of my choosing.</p>

            <p>I chose the industry of education, discussing the currently existing online educational softwares used and the issue behind this industry, which is that these services can not be accessed psuedononymously and seperate from the rest of the data on your operating system and devices, with the use of the only software which does this, the <a href="https://torproject.org">Tor browser</a> which utilizes the anonymity network Tor to encrypt and anonymize all traffic. The browser is isolationary and amnesic so as soon as it is closed out, all cookies are cleared and none of the sessions are associated with each other. Along with the use of the Tor network which selects 3 random IP addresses running relays which facilitate the Tor network and encrypts and anonymizes the user's traffic through these three IP addresses. I tried to see how much agency a K-12 student could attain over the data collected on them daily through the use of online educational services, and used my research to build my Freedom Project website.</p><br>

        <h2>Reflection</h2><br>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>I struggled with setting up the file path as I didn't undertstand that the file structure which the user clicks through to reveal the outcome and next coresponding linked files which they can choose does not have anything to do with how they are linked within the directory structure, and instead should be read from the README.md file.</p>

        <p>I didn't understand why files, except for empty files, were needed as the only way to link a path from the directories page on the homepage of the repository is to make all of the options the user can click on empty directories (having to be typed out with no spaces and also no proper punctuation) with the other options being directories within that folder, each folder having to be created with empty files so that it could be committed to Github.</p>

        <p>I had to go back to the example on the original CYOA assignment to see the demo in which the files are simply linked in text starting from the README.md file. This made it clear that no directories or actual file structure is needed for the in-text linked files, and directories where only required to show proper use of the Integrated Development Environment to make directories and structure files, such as all of the ones I linked together on Github, and all of the files my partner created and linked.</p>

        <h4>Takeaways</h4>
        <p>I see now that linking files does not require any specific setup with folder structure and directories. You can use the markdown language to link files within the text of other files to create a simple interactive game with only basic knowledge of the command line and some basic git commands. </p>

        <h4>Next Step</h4>
        <p>Since I initially misunderstood the project since I was absent on the day of the instruction for the file setup, I need to rememeber to utilize resources such as Slack to ask any questions even if I think I know what to do just to clarify and not waste any time and have to go back later and fix the files, instead of assuming what to do.</p>
